the executable takes these arguments
-t num 		EXECUTES OVER NUM THREADS
-n num		GENERATES A RANDOM MATRIX AND USES IT AS AN INPUT 
-i file 	USES FILE AS AN INPUT ( CONFLICTS WITH -n )
-q 		DOES NOT PRINT DEBUGGING INFO
-dm file	DUMPS THE MATRIX THAT IS USED INTO FILE

#MAX_DIGITS in input.c limits the max digits in a randomly generated matrix

using:
gmp.h
posix threads

./tests/test.sh [SIZE OF MATRIX] [FROM_THREADS] [TO_THREADS]	
COMPILES AND RUNS THE EXECUTABLE OVER FROM_THREADS TO TO_THREADS OVER RANDOM MATRIX WITH GIVEN SIZE(THE SAME MATRIX IS USED FOR ALL THE TESTS).
ADDITIONALLY IT RUNS THE EXECUTABLE OVER A 'WORST CASE SCENARIO' MATRIX WITH ONE VERY HEAVY ROW AT THE END.
THE RESULTS ARE LOGGED AT:
./test/times/normal/ 	THE TIME MEASUREMENTS OVER THE FIRST RANDOM MATRIX
./test/times/heavy/ 	THE TIME MEASUREMENTS OVER THE HEAVY MATRIX
./test/logs/ 		CONDENSED TIME MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER OUTPUT
./test/Rstuff/		MEASUREMENTS DIGESTED FOR R PLOTTING
example
	./tests/test.sh 100 15 32 		RUNS THE EXECUTABLE WITH 15 TO 32 THREADS OVER A MATRIX 100x100
	
./tests/purge.sh 	PURGES ALL OF THE COLLECTED DATA
